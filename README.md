# motivational_discord_bot
Motivational_discord_bot was created as my first final project learning python. I used discord's developers notes to be able to build the final output. The bot is able to react to events and send back: motivational quotes, encouraging words, compliments and links to gifs.

The bot pulls data from different .txt files, you can extend the lists with more data if needed.
